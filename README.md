# UChicagoNode

UChicagoNode is a collaboration between the University of Chicago Library and the Forum for Digital Culture, made possible by funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, designed to serve as a platform for the discovery, display and delivery of digital objects and collections at the University of Chicago, and information about them, as well as the Online Publication Service (OPS), peer-reviewed digital volumes supported by potentially large datasets of images, GIS, or other data. Initial implementation is planned for later in 2024.
